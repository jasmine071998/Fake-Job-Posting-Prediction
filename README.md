# Fake-Job-Posting-Prediction

Designed and implemented an advanced machine learning and natural language processing system that accurately identifies and filters fraudulent job postings from online recruitment platforms. The system makes use of an extensive dataset to train a variety of algorithms, as well as advanced data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques. This will facilitate the enhancement of trust and integrity across digital job marketplaces by protecting both job seekers and legitimate employers from the pervasive threat of online job scams.
